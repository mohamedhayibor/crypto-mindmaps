One way to think about cryptography is the manipulation of computational complexity.

The bread and butter being able to easily verify but very hard to compute without some secret information (keys or process).

Cryptography is making something hard by design. For instance making so hard that trying to guess (via brute force: trying all possible answers) requiring more than world's computational power.

If you're reading articles in the space you will come across the term "hashing" more than twousand of times.
Because it is a one way function it allows a bunch of Hashing allows you to: temper proof, authenticity, identity.

In the end as Gavin Wood put it "trust is blind faith" the more we can decrease our reliance on it the better.

Reward the people that strengthen the network
Penalize the people that weaken it
